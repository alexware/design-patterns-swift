# Proxy

### Description </br>
Proxy lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access to it. </br>

### iOS/MacOS adaptation </br>
NSProxy (Objective-C only). Attempting to derive a Swift class from NSProxy will generate a compiler error because it is impossible to call super.init from the derived class (because NSProxy doesnâ€™t define an initializer). </br>
